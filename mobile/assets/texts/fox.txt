Long long ago there lived a fox who loved to eat. He lived close to a vineyard and he used to stare at the lovely grapes that hung there.

"How juice they look. Oh I am sure these are stuff that melts in the mouth when you have them. If only I could reach them".

Fox and GrapesOne sunny day, the fox woke up and saw the grapes glistening by the sunlight. The vineyard looked heavenly and the grapes looked so luscious that the famished fox could no longer control itself. He jumped to reach them but fell down.

He jumped again. No, they were much higher.

He jumped even more. But they were still out of reach.

He jumped and stretched and hopped but to no avail. Those yummy grapes hung higher than the fox could reach. No matter how hard he tried, the fox could not reach the grapes. He panted and began to sweat out of exhaustion.

Giving up finally, he looked up in contempt and said as he walked away, "Those grapes surely must be sour. I wouldn't eat them even if they were served to me on a golden dish."

It's easy to despise what you cannot have.
