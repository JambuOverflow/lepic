Supporting the assessment and management of reading fluency.

## About the Project

This project was done during the Student Contest on Software Engineering (SCORE), that was part of the [43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2021)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021/score-2021#About). It consists of a mobile app for Android and iOS, and its main goal is to help teachers and other professionals that work with students' literacy and kid's relatives.

### Features

In the app, the teacher can:

* Add classes, students and texts.
* Upload recordings of the students reading the texts.
* Listen to the students' recordings, and indicate the mistakes they did when reading.

Then, the app automatically calculates these statistics:
 
* Duration of the reading.
* Number of words read per minute.
* Number of correct words read per minute.
* If the student has a deficit in his/her class.

With this information, the teachers will know which students need the most attention in their reading.
