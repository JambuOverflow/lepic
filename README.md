## About the Project

This project was made during the Student Contest on Software Engineering (SCORE), that was part of the [43rd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2021)](https://conf.researchr.org/home/icse-2021/score-2021#About). It consists of a mobile app, and its main goal is to develop a tool to support reading fluency assessment and management. The software aims to help teachers and other professionals that work with students' literacy and kid's relatives.

### Features

In the app, the teacher can.

* Add classes, students and texts.
* Upload recordings of the students reading the texts.
* Listen to the students' recordings, and indicate the mistakes they did while reading.

Then, the app automatically calculates these statistics:
 
* Time of the reading.
* Number of words read per minute.
* Number of correct words read per minute.
* If the student has a deficit in his/her class.

With this information, the teachers can know which students and need more attentional in their reading skills.
